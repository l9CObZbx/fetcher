/**
 * An error interceptor that handles HTTP 401 Unauthorized responses by invoking a custom callback.
 *
 * This interceptor is designed to provide centralized handling of authentication failures
 * across all HTTP requests. When a response with status code 401 is encountered, it calls
 * the configured `onUnauthorized` callback, allowing applications to implement custom
 * authentication recovery logic such as:
 * - Redirecting users to login pages
 * - Triggering token refresh flows
 * - Clearing stored authentication state
 * - Displaying authentication error messages
 *
 * The interceptor does not modify the response or retry requests automatically - it delegates
 * all handling to the provided callback function.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const interceptor = new UnauthorizedErrorInterceptor({
 *   onUnauthorized: (exchange) => {
 *     console.log('Unauthorized access detected for:', exchange.request.url);
 *     // Redirect to login page or refresh token
 *     window.location.href = '/login';
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * fetcher.interceptors.error.use(interceptor);
 * ```
