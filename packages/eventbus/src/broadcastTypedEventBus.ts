/**
 * Broadcast event bus that enables cross-tab/window communication
 *
 * This class extends a local TypedEventBus with cross-context broadcasting capabilities.
 * When events are emitted, they are first processed locally by the delegate bus, then
 * broadcasted to other browser contexts (tabs, windows, etc.) through the provided messenger.
 *
 * Incoming broadcast messages from other contexts are automatically forwarded to the
 * local delegate bus for processing by registered event handlers.
 *
 * @template EVENT - The event type this bus handles (must be serializable for cross-context transport)
 *
 * @example Basic usage with default messenger
 * ```typescript
 * import { SerialTypedEventBus } from './serialTypedEventBus';
 * import { BroadcastTypedEventBus } from './broadcastTypedEventBus';
 *
 * // Create local event bus
 * const delegate = new SerialTypedEventBus<string>('user-events');
 *
 * // Create broadcast event bus with default messenger
 * const bus = new BroadcastTypedEventBus({
 *   delegate
 *   // messenger will be auto-created as '_broadcast_:user-events'
 * });
 *
 * // Register event handler
 * bus.on({
 *   name: 'user-login',
 *   order: 1,
 *   handle: (username: string) => console.log(`User ${username} logged in`)
 * });
 *
 * // Emit event (will be processed locally and broadcasted to other tabs)
 * await bus.emit('john-doe');
 * ```
 *
 * @example Using custom messenger
 * ```typescript
 * import { SerialTypedEventBus } from './serialTypedEventBus';
 * import { createCrossTabMessenger } from './messengers';
 * import { BroadcastTypedEventBus } from './broadcastTypedEventBus';
 *
 * // Create local event bus
 * const delegate = new SerialTypedEventBus<string>('user-events');
 *
 * // Create custom cross-tab messenger
 * const messenger = createCrossTabMessenger('my-custom-channel');
 *
 * // Create broadcast event bus
 * const bus = new BroadcastTypedEventBus({
 *   delegate,
 *   messenger
 * });
 *
 * // Register event handler and emit events...
 * ```
 *
 * @example Using custom messenger implementation
 * ```typescript
 * class CustomMessenger implements CrossTabMessenger {
 *   // ... implementation
 * }
 *
 * const customMessenger = new CustomMessenger();
 * const bus = new BroadcastTypedEventBus({
 *   delegate: new SerialTypedEventBus('events'),
 *   messenger: customMessenger
 * });
