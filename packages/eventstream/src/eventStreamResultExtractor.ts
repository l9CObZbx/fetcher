/**
 * ServerSentEventStream result extractor for Fetcher HTTP client.
 *
 * This result extractor is designed to work with the Fetcher HTTP client library.
 * It extracts a ServerSentEventStream from an HTTP response that contains Server-Sent Events.
 * The extractor validates that the response supports event streaming and converts the
 * response body into a properly typed event stream.
 *
 * This extractor should be used when you want to consume raw Server-Sent Events
 * without JSON parsing, maintaining the original string data format.
 *
 * @param exchange - The FetchExchange object containing request and response information
 * @returns A ReadableStream that yields ServerSentEvent objects as they are parsed from the response
 * @throws {ExchangeError} When the server response does not support ServerSentEventStream
 *                         (e.g., wrong content type, no response body)
 *
