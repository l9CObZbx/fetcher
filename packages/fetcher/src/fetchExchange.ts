 * Container for HTTP request/response data that flows through the interceptor chain.

 * FetchExchange instances are unique within a single request scope, meaning each HTTP
 * request creates its own FetchExchange instance that is passed through the interceptor
 * chain for that specific request.

 * ```typescript
 * // In a request interceptor
 * const requestInterceptor: Interceptor = {
 *   name: 'RequestInterceptor',
 *   order: 0,
 *   intercept(exchange: FetchExchange) {
 *     // Add custom data to share with other interceptors
 *     exchange.attributes = exchange.attributes || {};
 *     exchange.attributes.startTime = Date.now();
 *     exchange.attributes.customHeader = 'my-value';
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * // In a response interceptor
 * const responseInterceptor: Interceptor = {
 *   name: 'ResponseInterceptor',
 *   order: 0,
 *   intercept(exchange: FetchExchange) {
 *     // Access data shared by previous interceptors
 *     if (exchange.attributes && exchange.attributes.startTime) {
 *       const startTime = exchange.attributes.startTime;
 *       const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
