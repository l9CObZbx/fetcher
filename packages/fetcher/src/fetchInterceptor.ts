 * processing chain, ensuring that the actual network request is executed after all
 * previous interceptors have completed processing.
 *

 * This interceptor runs at the very end of the request interceptor chain to ensure
 * that the actual HTTP request is executed after all other request processing is complete.
 * The order is set to FETCH_INTERCEPTOR_ORDER to ensure it executes after all other
 * request interceptors, completing the request processing pipeline before the network
 * request is made. This positioning ensures that all request preprocessing is
 * completed before the actual network request is made.

 * // Usually not created manually as Fetcher uses it automatically
 * const fetcher = new Fetcher();
 * // FetchInterceptor is automatically registered in fetcher.interceptors.request
