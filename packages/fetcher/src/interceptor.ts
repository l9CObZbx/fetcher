 * Interface for HTTP interceptors in the fetcher pipeline.

 * Interceptors are middleware components that can modify requests, responses, or handle errors
 * at different stages of the HTTP request lifecycle. They follow the Chain of Responsibility
 * pattern, where each interceptor can process the exchange object and pass it to the next.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example of a custom request interceptor
 * const customRequestInterceptor: Interceptor = {
 *   name: 'CustomRequestInterceptor',
 *   order: 100,
 *   async intercept(exchange: FetchExchange): Promise<void> {
 *     // Modify request headers
 *     exchange.request.headers = {
 *       ...exchange.request.headers,
 *       'X-Custom-Header': 'custom-value'
 *     };
 *   }
