/**
 * Collection of interceptor managers for the Fetcher client.
 *
 * Manages three types of interceptors:
 * 1. Request interceptors - Process requests before sending HTTP requests
 * 2. Response interceptors - Process responses after receiving HTTP responses
 * 3. Error interceptors - Handle errors when they occur during the request process
 *
 * Each type of interceptor is managed by an InterceptorRegistry instance, supporting
 * adding, removing, and executing interceptors.
 *
 * @example
 * // Create a custom interceptor
 * const customRequestInterceptor: Interceptor = {
 *   name: 'CustomRequestInterceptor',
 *   order: 100,
 *   async intercept(exchange: FetchExchange): Promise<FetchExchange> {
 *     // Modify request headers
 *     exchange.request.headers = {
 *       ...exchange.request.headers,
 *       'X-Custom-Header': 'custom-value'
 *     };
 *     return exchange;
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * // Add interceptor to Fetcher
 * const fetcher = new Fetcher();
 * fetcher.interceptors.request.use(customRequestInterceptor);
 *
 * @remarks
 * By default, the request interceptor registry has three built-in interceptors registered:
 * 1. UrlResolveInterceptor - Resolves the final URL with parameters
 * 2. RequestBodyInterceptor - Automatically converts object-type request bodies to JSON strings
 * 3. FetchInterceptor - Executes actual HTTP requests and handles timeouts

   * 1. UrlResolveInterceptor (order: Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER) - Resolves the final URL

  /**
   * Processes a FetchExchange through the interceptor pipeline.
   *
   * This method is the core of the Fetcher's interceptor system. It executes the three
   * phases of interceptors in sequence:
   * 1. Request interceptors - Process the request before sending
   * 2. Response interceptors - Process the response after receiving
   * 3. Error interceptors - Handle any errors that occurred during the process
   *
   * The interceptor pipeline follows the Chain of Responsibility pattern, where each
   * interceptor can modify the exchange object and decide whether to continue or
   * terminate the chain.
   *
   * @param fetchExchange - The exchange object containing request, response, and error information
   * @returns Promise that resolves to the processed FetchExchange
   * @throws ExchangeError if an unhandled error occurs during processing
   *
   * @remarks
   * The method handles three distinct phases:
   *
   * 1. Request Phase: Executes request interceptors which can modify headers, URL, body, etc.
   *    Built-in interceptors handle URL resolution, body serialization, and actual HTTP execution.
   *
   * 2. Response Phase: Executes response interceptors which can transform or validate responses.
   *    These interceptors only run if the request phase completed without throwing.
   *
   * 3. Error Phase: Executes error interceptors when any phase throws an error. Error interceptors
   *    can handle errors by clearing the error property. If error interceptors clear the error,
   *    the exchange is returned successfully.
   *
   * Error Handling:
   * - If any interceptor throws an error, the error phase is triggered
   * - Error interceptors can "fix" errors by clearing the error property on the exchange
   * - If errors remain after error interceptors run, they are wrapped in ExchangeError
   *
   * Order of Execution:
   * 1. Request interceptors (sorted by order property, ascending)
   * 2. Response interceptors (sorted by order property, ascending) - only if no error in request phase
   * 3. Error interceptors (sorted by order property, ascending) - only if an error occurred
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Create a fetcher with custom interceptors
   * const fetcher = new Fetcher();
   *
   * // Add a request interceptor
   * fetcher.interceptors.request.use({
   *   name: 'AuthInterceptor',

   *     exchange.request.headers = {

   *       'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + getToken()
   *     };
   *   }
   * });
   *
   * // Add a response interceptor
   * fetcher.interceptors.response.use({
   *   name: 'ResponseLogger',
   *   order: 100,
   *   async intercept(exchange: FetchExchange) {
   *     console.log(`Response status: ${exchange.response?.status}`);
   *   }
