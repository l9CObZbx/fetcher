 * A termination detector for OpenAI chat completion streams.

 * This detector identifies when a chat completion stream has finished by checking

 * signal used by OpenAI's API for streaming chat completions.
 *
 * @param event - The server-sent event to evaluate for termination
 * @returns true if the event indicates stream completion, false otherwise
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const event: ServerSentEvent = { data: '[DONE]', event: 'done' };
 * const isDone = DoneDetector(event); // returns true

/**
 * Result extractor for OpenAI chat completion streaming responses.
 *
 * This extractor processes HTTP responses from OpenAI's chat completion API endpoints
 * that return streaming responses. It converts the response into a JSON server-sent
 * event stream that automatically terminates when the completion is finished.
 *
 * The extractor uses the DoneDetector to identify completion signals and ensures
 * the response is properly formatted as a server-sent event stream with JSON data.
 *
 * @param exchange - The fetch exchange containing the HTTP response from OpenAI's API
 * @returns A JSON server-sent event stream of ChatResponse objects that terminates on completion
 * @throws {EventStreamConvertError} If the response is not a valid event stream or has incorrect content type
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { fetcher } from '@ahoo-wang/fetcher';
 * import { CompletionStreamResultExtractor } from '@ahoo-wang/fetcher-openai';
 *
 * const response = await fetcher.post('/chat/completions', {
 *   model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
 *   messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
 *   stream: true
 * });
 *
 * const stream = CompletionStreamResultExtractor(response);
 *
 * for await (const event of stream) {
 *   console.log('Received:', event.data);
 *   // Stream automatically terminates when '[DONE]' is received
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Using with fetcher configuration
 * const fetcherWithExtractor = fetcher.extend({
 *   resultExtractor: CompletionStreamResultExtractor
 * });
 *
 * const stream = await fetcherWithExtractor.post('/chat/completions', {
 *   // ... request options
 * });
 * ```
